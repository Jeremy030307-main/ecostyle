## Versioning Strategy

We follow Semantic Versioning:

- Major versions (X.0.0): Introduces breaking changes that are not backward compatible
- Minor versions (X.Y.0): Adds new features while maintaining backward compatibility
- Update versions (X.Y.Z): Includes small bug fixes and performance improvements.

Version updates can be tagged in the GitLab repository to ensure clarity and traceability.

## Pull Request Strategy

To ensure code quality and maintainability, we follow a structured pull request (PR) process:

- All code changes must be submitted via pull requests (PRs)
- Each PR must be linked to a relevant issue (if applicable) to maintain traceability
- At least one reviewer approval is required before merging
- Code must follow the project's coding standards and include necessary tests/documentation
- PRs should include a clear description of changes through commit message of the problem being addressed
